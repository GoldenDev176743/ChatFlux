<p>This policy is effective as of 24 November 2023</p>
<p>Last updated: 24 November 2023</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p>
<p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services and promotions.</p>
<p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our products and services.</p>
<h3>Device Data</h3>
<p>When you visit our website or interact with our services, we may automatically collect data about your device, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP</li>
</ul>
<p>Data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and software. We recommend checking the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn what information they make available to us.</p>
<h4>Transaction Data</h4>
<p>Transaction data refers to data that accumulates over the normal course of operation on our platform. This may include transaction records, stored files, user profiles, analytics data and other metrics, as well as other types of information, created or generated, as users interact with our services.</p>

<h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and no one can guarantee absolute data security.</p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring you do not make your personal information publicly available via our platform.</p>
<h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information such as an email address when contacting us about a specific enquiry, we may retain this information for the duration of your enquiry remaining open as well as for our own records so we may effectively address similar enquiries in future. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.</p>
<p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p>

<h3>Additional Disclosures for UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) Compliance (UK)</h3>
<h4>Data Controller / Data Processor</h4>
<p>The GDPR distinguishes between organisations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). For the purposes covered by this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller with respect to the personal information you provide to us and remain compliant with our data controller obligations under GDPR.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Provided Content</h4>
<p>We may indirectly collect personal information about you from third-parties who have your permission to share it. For example, if you purchase a product or service from a business working with us, and give your permission for us to use your details in order to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>We may also collect publicly available information about you, such as from any social media and messaging platforms you may use. The availability of this information will depend on both the privacy policies and your own privacy settings on such platforms.</p>
<h4>Additional Disclosure for Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned purposes warranting the collection and use of personal information, we may also conduct marketing and market research activities, including how visitors use our site, website improvement opportunities and user experience.</p>
<h4>Personal Information No Longer Required for Our Purposes</h4>
<p>If your personal information is no longer required for our stated purposes, or if you instruct us under your Data Subject Rights, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you (“Anonymisation”). However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p>
<h3>Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>Data Protection and Privacy Laws permit us to collect and use your personal data on a limited number of grounds.. In which case, we will collect and use your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We never directly market to any person(s) under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This is a non-exhaustive list of the lawful bases we use:</p>
<h4>Consent From You</h4>
<p>Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. When you contact us, we assume your consent based on your positive action of contact, therefore you consent to your name and email address being used so we can respond to your enquiry.</p>
<p>Where you agree to receive marketing communications from us, we will do so based solely on your indication of consent or until you instruct us not to, which you can do at any time.</p>
<p>While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p>
<h4>Performance of a Contract or Transaction</h4>
<p>Where you have entered into a contract or transaction with us, or in order to take preparatory steps prior to our entering into a contract or transaction with you. For example, if you contact us with an enquiry, we may require personal information such as your name and contact details in order to respond.</p>
<h4>Our Legitimate Interests</h4>
<p>Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as for us to provide, operate, improve and communicate our services. We consider our legitimate interests to include research and development, understanding our audience, marketing and promoting our services, measures taken to operate our services efficiently, marketing analysis, and measures taken to protect our legal rights and interests.</p>
<h4>Compliance with Law</h4>
<p>In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal information. Such cases may include (but are not limited to) court orders, criminal investigations, government requests, and regulatory obligations. For example, we are required to keep financial records for a period of 7 years. If you have any further enquiries about how we retain personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p>
<h4>International Transfers of Personal Information</h4>
<p>The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in the United Kingdom by us. Following an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, the UK has been granted an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed under UK GDPR.</p>
<p>On some occasions, where we share your data with third parties, they may be based outside of the UK, or the European Economic Area (“EEA”). These countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.</p>
<p>If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of the UK GDPR (Article 45) and Data Protection Act 2018;</li>
<li>we will adopt appropriate safeguards for protecting the transferred data, including in transit, such as standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) or binding corporate rules.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Your Data Subject Rights</h4>
<p><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be informed with how your data is collected, processed, shared and stored.</p>
<p><strong>Right of Access:</strong> You may request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you at any time by submitting a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR). The statutory deadline for fulfilling a DSAR request is 30 calendar days from our receipt of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> In certain circumstances, you can ask for your personal data to be erased from the records held by organisations. However this is a qualified right; it is not absolute, and may only apply in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>When may the right to erasure apply?</p>
<ul>
<li>When the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed for.</li>
<li>If consent was the lawful basis for processing personal data and that consent has been withdrawn. Chatflux.io relies on consent to process personal data in very few circumstances.</li>
<li>The Company is relying on legitimate interests as a legal basis for processing personal data and an individual has exercised the right to object and it has been determined that the Company has no overriding legitimate grounds to refuse that request.</li>
<li>Personal data are being processed for direct marketing purposes e.g. a person’s name and email address, and the individual objects to that processing.</li>
<li>There is legislation that requires that personal data are to be destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals have the right to get some of their personal data from an organisation in a way that is accessible and machine-readable, for example as a csv file. Associated with this, individuals also have the right to ask an organisation to transfer their personal data to another organisation.</p>
<p>However, the right to portability:</p>
<ul>
<li>only applies to personal data which a person has directly given to Chatflux.io in electronic form; and</li>
<li>onward transfer will only be available where this is “technically feasible”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, individuals have the right to correct, update or complete that data. Collectively this is referred to as the right to rectification. Rectification may involve filling the gaps i.e. to have to have incomplete personal data completed – although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This may involve adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete data to highlight any inaccuracy or claim thereof.</p>
<p>This right only applies to an individual’s own personal data; a person cannot seek the rectification of another person’s information.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> Upon discovery of a data breach, we will investigate the incident and report it to the UK’s data protection regulator and yourself, if we deem it appropriate to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right, at any time, to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance using the details below. Please provide us with as much information as you can about the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint.</p>
